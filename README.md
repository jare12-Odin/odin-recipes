Hello
In this repository you'll find the projects and attempts of creating
a recipe website.

I will demonstrate my basic knowledge of HTML 5 with the use of
hyperlink references, images, paragraphs and others.

Along with this, I will demonstrate my skills of git by cloning,
committing and pushing file as I go along with the project.
